uploading different functionalities code into a remote server (version controling system)
accepts the code + integrates the code+ creates one project
we can jump to any version of code 
keep a track of who is making what kind of changes

Notes:

Version Controlling:

This is the process of maintaining different versions of the code.All the team members upload the code into the remote 
version controlling server where the code get integrated into a single project.
Next time when the team members download the code they will be able to access the code created by the entire team.

Version controlling systems also preserve older and latest versions of the code
so that the team members can switch between any version based on their requirement

Version controlling systems also keep a track of who is making what kind of changes.

There are two types of version controlling
1. Centralised version controlling
2. Distributed Version Controlling

Centralised version controlling:
------------------------------------
In CVC we have a remote server where all the code is uploaded and version controlling
happens only that remote server Eg.SVN ( subversion)

Distributed Version Controlling:
--------------------------------
In DVC a local repository is installed on every developers machine where
initially the code is uploaded by the developer.Here version controlling happens only at the level of individual developer
Later the code will be uploaded into a remote server where version controlling happens at the level of the entire team

In DVC we can also create bare repositories that is repositories at individual team level or sub team level or 
a main repository at the level of the entire project

Installing GIT on Windows:
-------------------------
1)Download from google
2)Install it
3)Once git installed we get an application called gitbash
 This is the command promt of git where we can fire git commands

Install git on Redhar,Centos linux machines:
-------------------------------------------

yum -y install git

setting username and email globally for all users
-----------------------------------------
git config --global user.name "amulya gurijala"
git config --global user.email "amulyareddy220@gmail.com"
