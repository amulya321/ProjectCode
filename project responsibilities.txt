Intro:

I am currently working for xyz company for ABC client.This is an application related to xyz/consumer facing domain.
The projects for which am working is a Java based application.And our devs are using GIT for version controlling.
One of my responsibility as a devops engineer is to perform Continuous Intergartion ,for this we are using Jenkins.
I have Integrated Jenkins with the GIT version controlling System in such a way that when ever developer modifies the code
jenkins recives a notification.I hve configured webhooks for this purpose.Jenkins pulls that code and triggers the build process.
This we are performing with the help of Maven plugin.I have configured jenkins to deploy this artifacts into the test servers.
These servers are running on tomcat.we have an automation testing team who created automation test programs using selenium and Jmeter.
Jenkins executes these automation test programs and checks If the application is working correctly.Later Jenkins will deploy this application 
into the staging servers where it executes certain UAT testcases created by the testers.If the UAT testing passes Jenkins takes approvals from
the delivery team and deploys it into the production servers.To implement this flow of CI/CD we are using Pipeline scripts created through groovy.
Since we need to run multiple jenkins jobs sometimes parallelly to reduce the load on the jenkins server ,I have created slave machines and 
jenkins distributes its load to slave machines.Our sprint duration is generally 3-4 weeks and we configure Jenkins for that.We also have sub sprints
once in every 3-4 days where we have minor releases.So we run these Jenkins jobs for the minor releases also,since our devs upload multiple functionalities
code on multiple branches of GIT.I have configured multi branch pipeline jobs in Jenkins.
   Since the last 2 years we started implementing Docker.As I told you earlier our application is Java based.The DB's are running on MySQL .And for Application
 servers we are using TomCat.This complete environment we have set up via Docker containers.For this we are using Docker Compose.Another important project 
that we have done on docker was creating the required testing environment using Docker.Our Automation testing team estimated that this Application has 
to be tested on multiple browser and OS combinations.They estimated approximately 800+ browser and OS combinations,on which they wanted to run the
automation test scripts.Since creating such a huge infra structure of 800+ browser and OS combination is very difficult.Our organization initially depended on
a cloud service provider called Sauce Labs.But as it was very expensive, I did a little POC and created this complete environment of 800+ browser and OS combinations
using Docker containers.
 I am also involved in creating customized Docker Images based on organizations requirements and these Images I upload into the Docker private Registry that I have
set up.We are also using Docker at the level of production where we are using Kubernaties.Where we handling all the real time scenarios like Load balancing,high availability,
disaster recovery,scaling etc.For some reason our management has decided to migrate from kubernaties to Swarm.Due to this reason I have working knowledge of
both Kubernaties and Swarm.
  We have our data center in California where our Applications are running on almost 1200 servers.Configuring these servers remotely is another day to day activity that we
performed.For this we are using Anisble.I create play books and Roles in Anisble for remotely configuring software applications on these servers.I have remotely configured
applications like Tomcat,httpd,ftd,NFS etc.Recently I have started working on Integrating Docker with Ansible,so that we can perform Docker containerization on any number of 
remote servers.We also used Python scripts for creating customized programs for handling day to day activities on Jenkins and Docker.
